This project aims to visualize data from a CSV file that contains information on investment funds. The main functionality of this code is to read the CSV file, process it, and display the data in the form of a bar chart. The user can select a column from the bar chart, and the corresponding rows will be displayed in a data frame. Additionally, the code will search for the selected fund on a website and display the URL of the fund's page.

## Requirements

This code requires the following Python libraries:

io
requests
streamlit
pandas
wget
streamlit_plotly_events
plotly.express
re

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt in the terminal.
Run the main.py file by running streamlit run main.py in the terminal.
Upload the CSV file by clicking the upload button.
The bar chart will be displayed. Select a column from the chart to view the corresponding rows in the data frame.
The code will search for the selected fund on a website and display the URL of the fund's page.
